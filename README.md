+ # SENET
 A novel architecture ,SENET which seems to be consistent with the real-world applications and more proper than the other styles, was introduced. SENET which has been proposed to manage WSNs, is based on the concepts of AI, the internet of thing (IoT) devices, and the wearable or embedded WSNs. 
 

+  # Proposed architecture 

 SENET consists of three layers and exploits AI, WBSNs, and IoT-based programmable devices. The AI methods generate the real-time models which can not only predict the undesired events but also produce the required reports. For the purpose of enhancing the reliability in the SENET’ intermediate layer, head clusters cover WBSNs in such a way that every mobile sensor is supported by at least a k node. 
 
+ # The performance
 We have used four efficient and popular algorithms (WCC, PSO, ACO, and GA) is investigated to evaluate  SENET  method.
 The identical circumstances such as the total number of calling the score function,  the total number of individuals in the first population of candidate solutions etc. were taken into account in the process of comparing the algorithms. 
 
The results show that not only the SENET architecture saves the energy consumed by the wireless sensors,
but also the WCC algorithm is a suitable option for determining the positions of sensors in the proposed architecture in terms of WSNs’ energy-consumption, the total number of required sensors, and reliability.
